# Underground Pen and Paper

Welcome to the Underground Pen and Paper project.

The goal of this project is an open (and free) rulebook for a pen and paper system for fans of metro books/games.

Feel free to contribute. Because I work with gitbook you can fork this project load it too your own gitbook envionment and merge your changes to your fork. Finally open a pull request in the related Repo
